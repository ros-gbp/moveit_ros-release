ros-indigo-moveit-ros-robot-interaction (0.7.0-0saucy) saucy; urgency=high

  * Removed trailing whitespace from entire repository
  * further adapted marker size computation
    - drop largest extension dimension (-> use cross-section size of elongated link)
    - for an end-effector group, consider the sizes of individual links
    instead of the overall size of all links (which becomes huge very fast)
    - enlarge marker size by factor of 1.5 when there is only a single eef marker
  * reworked computeLinkMarkerSize()
    compute size such that the marker sphere will cover
    - a spherical link geometry -> AABB.maxCoeff
    - a cubical link geometry -> AABB.norm
    -> use average of both values
    Virtual links (without any shape) will have a size of AABB of zero dims.
    In this case use the dimensions of the closest parent link instead.
  * improved computation of interactive marker size
    - use parent_link if group == parent_group
    - scale smaller than 5cm is clipped to 5cm instead of using default
    - clarified size computation, using diameter of AABB
  * fixing error caused by BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT
  * Fixed compile error caused by BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT in kinematic_options.cpp
    Added kinematics::DiscretizationMethods::DiscretizationMethod to QO_FIELDS in kinematic_options.cpp.
    At pull request #581, type of discretization_method was set to int. Changed it to proper type.
  * reinstated changes related to the updates in the  moveit_core::KinematicsBase interface
  * adds the 'returns_approximate_solution' entry so that it is compatible with the changes in kinematics::KinematicsBase class in the moveit_core repo

  * Fix coding style according to the moveit style
  * update joystick documentation according to the latest implementation
  * add checkbox to toggle if moveit rviz plugin subscribes
    the topics to be used for communication to the external ros nodes.
    update moveit_joy.py to parse srdf to know planning_groups and the
    names of the end effectors and support multi-endeffector planning groups.
  * adding PoseStamped topic to move the interactive marker from other ros nodes
    such as joystick programs.

  * fix test
    This was testing functionality that got removed.  Removed that part of the
    test.
  * robot_interaction: add comments
    Comment cryptic public function behavior.
  * robot_interaction: fix formatting
    remove tabs and whitespace at the end of lines.
  * robot_interaction: fix comment formatting
    Limit lines to 120 chars max (80 preferred in headers).
  * robot_interaction: fix setStateFromIK prototypes
    use references instead of pointers.
  * robot_interaction: fix header problems
    fix getRobotModel() bug
    make internal functions private.
  * remove extraneous code
  * add missing headers
  * robot_interaction: Fix issues raised by Ioan
  * robot_interaction: use LockedRobotState
    Fix a number of thread safety violations.
  * robot_interaction: add LockedRobotState and tests
  * robot_interaction: use KinematicOptionsMap
    Fixes threading issues.
    Separate the handling of kinematics options into a separate object which
    enforces thread safe access.
  * robot_interaction: add KinematicOptions
    KinematicOptions contains the parameters needed to call RobotState::setFromIK.
    KinematicOptionsMap contains a map of string->KinematicOptions a default KinematicOptions.
    These are useful in RobotInteraction with the group name as the key.
  * pull RobotInteraction structures out of class
    The Generic, EndEffector, and Joint structures complicate the core of
    RobotInteraction.  Pull them out to simplify the code.  This will also
    help with future plans to make the core of RobotInteraction more
    generic and flexible.
  * fix include guards to match moveit conventions
  * robot_interaction: include interaction_handler.h from robot_interaction.h
    This is for backwards compatibility with code that only includes
    robot_interaction.h
  * robot_interaction: split handler into own file
  * robot_interaction: split InteractionHandler into its own file
  * robot_interaction: make lock-protected members private
    Since the lock is needed to access these and the lock is private it makes no
    sense for them to be protected.
  * robot_interaction: add locking comments
  * robot_interaction: simplify code
  * robot_interaction: fix comments
